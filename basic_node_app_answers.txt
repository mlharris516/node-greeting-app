EXERCISES

1. What is a Node module?

    A file containing a block of code that contains a function that accomplishes a specific job that you want to include in a node.js application.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?

    module.exports is the keyword that can make a certain piece of code available outside of the module file. It is also the object returned from the import function: require(). Using the keyword "exports" is a reference to the module.exports object, and also exports the desired code.

3. Why is using exports recommended?

    It is a reference to the same empty object that module.exports refers to, and it means writing less code when creating modules.
